{- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 -
 - 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 - The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 -
 - (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 - Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
 - and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

 - Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
 - numbers and the square of the sum. -}
