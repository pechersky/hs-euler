{- The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
 -
 - n → n/2 (n is even)
 - n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
 -
 - Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
 -
 - 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
 - It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms.
 - Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
 -
 - Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
 -
 - NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million. -}
