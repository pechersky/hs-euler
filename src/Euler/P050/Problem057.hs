 - It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an
 - infinite continued fraction.
 -
 - âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...
 -
 - By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
 -
 - 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
 - 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
 - 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
 - 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...
 -
 - The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth
 - expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the
 - numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.
 -
 - In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator
 - with more digits than denominator?
